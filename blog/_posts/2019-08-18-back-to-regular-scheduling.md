Welcome back friends. Its been exactly two years since my last post.<br><br>

I had no intention of abandoning my blog, but life happened. I intend to come
back and resume blogging about dev related topics! I hope you will continue to
join me as I explore new and interesting topics, and as always feel free to
reach out to me on [Twitter]({{ site.twitter_profile }}) and suggest new topics
for me to cover!
