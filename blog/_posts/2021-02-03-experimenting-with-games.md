So... I'm back. Its been nearly another two and a half years since my last
post, but the world has changed quite a bit (see: COVID-19).

<br>
At the end of last year I got a new job! With this, I need to learn and
master a bunch of new topics! Since I always have a bunch of fun with
[js13kGames](https://js13kgames.com/) every year, I'm trying to commit to
making games to learn new topics.

<br>
I've followed [Christer Kaitila](https://twitter.com/mcfunkypants) for years
and really enjoyed the [#1GAM](http://onegameamonth.com/) challenge, so I'm
low-key doing it for myself. I think 1 month is a sufficient amount of time to
make the simple games that I'm targeting and its a long enough cycle time for
me to tinker with new concepts. You can follow along on the blog where I plan
to write a little retro about each game and play all the games on my new
[game portal](https://games.zackurben.com/).

<br>
Let me know if you play any of the games or have any issues. As always, feel
free to reach out to me on [Twitter]({{ site.twitter_profile }}) or via
[email](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
